/// All function nodes in the call-graph are parameterized over an implicit
/// argument ``#i:t_i`` (coming first) that represents the specialization index.
///
/// The goal is to perform a call-graph rewriting, as follows.
///
/// At definition-site, every function ``f #i x`` is replaced by a function
///  ``mk_f #i (g1: g1_t i) ... (gn: gn_t i) x`` where:
///
/// - the gi are the ``specialize`` nodes reachable via a (possibly-empty) path
///   of ``inline`` nodes through the body of ``f``
/// - the gi_t are the types of the original gi, minus that index i, which has
///   been abstracted over, i.e. if gi had type ``#i:t_i -> t`` then ``gi_t`` is
///   ``fun #i:t_i -> t``
///
/// At call-site, when encountering ``f #i e``, we distinguish between two cases.
///
/// - If ``f`` is a specialize node: this becomes ``gi e`` and references the
///   bound variable instead of the global name
/// - If ``f`` is an inline node: this becomes ``mk_f #i gf1 ... gfn e`` where
///   ``gfi`` is the i-th function needed by f, i.e. one of our gk.
///
/// The intended usage is as follows.
///
/// - For each specialize node ``f``, clients instantiate as follows:
///   ``let f_specialized = mk_f I1 g1_specialized ... gn_specialized``
///   where the gn_specialized have been recursively generated the same way.
///
/// The new (rewritten) name of inline nodes is part of the global tactic state,
/// which we thread through as ``state`` below.

// TODO:
// - quote and splice the internal state of the tactic as `tactic_state`; this way:
//   - a new tactic instantiate can re-load the state, then
//   - instantiate each one of the specialize nodes, and
//   - mark as private those that were not arguments to the tactic initially
// - figure out the bug in Example (might pop up later, 0b1611a5f03d9f91359eae54403da42957cfeb67)
// - figure out the issue with type annotations sending F* off the rails
//   (88c8ec01e066ab0adc550c2bdba4212ff5e7c5c9)
// - is there any way to not do as much work and skip re-checking some things?
// - the order of arguments is unspecified and gives surprising results; any way
//   we can make it more stable?
